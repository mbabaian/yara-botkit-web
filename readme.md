### >> Due to Facebook's policy change regarding bots, and a couple of other things, YARA is moving to a web platform, and some features are changing as a result. <<

### [YARA](https://dear-chill.glitch.me/)

#### Current Version 0.0.1
YARA is an open-source bot that makes book recommedations based on a patron's reading interests. While the focus of YARA is young adult readers in high school, it can be adapted to fit the needs of any community of readers.

Since this is a side project and I am not a professional developer, you may hit a few snags here and there. I welcome any comments or bug reports. Please contact me via the email listed in the Authors section at the bottom of this page or submit an Issue. 

In the meantime, I encourage you to adapt and use YARA to meet the needs of your library patrons.

### Purpose
I created YARA as a unique way to promote the school library program and increase circulation statistics. 

### What YARA Does
- Conducts basic reference interview using natural language
- Provides book recommendations based on reading preferences
- Includes link to library card catalog 
- Engages in polite small talk 

### What YARA Doesn't Do
 - Conduct card catalog searches for patrons (will be added in the future)
 - Get the status of an item (CKO/CKI/Lost)
 - Rank books by popularity
 
### How YARA Works
~~The user can initiate the conversation with a simple hello or hi.~~ After a few basic questions about reading interests, YARA gives the user a list of recommended books and provides a link to the school's card catalog.

### Fiction
~~At this time, YARA handles a limited number of fiction categories and themes:
- Fantasy
- Romance
- Dystopian
- Time Travel
- Humor
- Horror
- Vampires
- Zombies
- Realistic fiction
- Historical fiction
- Spies/Espionage
- Fae/Faeries
- Mystery

~~Future versions will include an expanded selection of genres and titles.

Since YARA now queries Google Books, all young adult fiction categories are available. This change is meant to simulate how YARA would work if connected to an actual card catalog.

### Nonfiction
~~Currently, YARA does not have a nonfiction category. If the patron states a preference for nonfiction, YARA provides a direct link to the card catalog. If there is a demand for nonfiction, I will add it to future versions. But you are, of course, welcome to make any changes to YARA that you'd like.~~

YARA is now capable of searching nonfiction. Please note that YARA's default setting is for young adult literature.


### Fun Stuff
Try one of the following phrases with YARA:
 
"My name is ________". 

"Who am I?"

"Who are you?" or "Who made you?"

"How are you?" or "hru?"

"I love you."

"I need a book." 

"I love books."

"Do you have any books with vampires?"

"Can you recommend some sci fi books?"

"Thank you."

"Goodbye."

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è YARA should never be used to collect information about patrons or judge their reading interests or the manner in which they communicate with YARA. If this is your reason for implementing YARA in your school library, please reconsider. A good librarian knows better.

Librarians are encouraged to customize YARA to match their specific collections and meet the needs of their students and teachers.
