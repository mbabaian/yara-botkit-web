### [YARA](https://dear-chill.glitch.me/)

#### Current Version 0.0.1
YARA makes book recommedations based on a patron's reading interests. While the focus of YARA is young adult readers, it can be adapted to fit the needs of any community of readers.

Since this is a side project and I am not a professional developer, you may hit a few snags here and there. I welcome any comments or bug reports. Please contact me via the email listed in the Authors section at the bottom of this page or submit an Issue. 

### Purpose
I created YARA as a unique way to promote the school library program and increase circulation statistics. 

### What YARA Does
- Conducts basic reference interview using natural language
- Provides book recommendations based on reading preferences
- Includes link to library card catalog 
- Engages in polite small talk 

### What YARA Doesn't Do
 - Conduct card catalog searches for patrons (will be added in the future)
 - Get the status of an item (CKO/CKI/Lost)
 - Rank books by popularity
 
### How YARA Works
After a few basic questions about reading interests, YARA gives the user a list of recommended books and provides a link to the school's card catalog.

### Fiction
Since YARA now queries Google Books, all young adult fiction categories are available. This change is meant to simulate how YARA would work if connected to an actual card catalog.

### Nonfiction
YARA is now capable of searching nonfiction. Please note that YARA's default setting is for young adult literature.
